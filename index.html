            <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is not a programming language; it
                is a <em>markup language</em> used to tell your browser how to structure
                the web pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple as the web
                developer wishes it to be. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you
                can use to enclose, wrap, or <em>mark up</em> different parts of the content
                into a hyperlink to link to another page on the web, italicize words, and
                so on. For example, take the following line of content:</p>
            <code id="code">1 | My cat is very grumpy</code>
            <p>If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a
                paragraph by enclosing it in a paragraph &lt p &gt element: </p>
            <code id="code">1 | &ltp&gt My cat is very grumpy &lt/p&gt</code>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Anatomy_of_an_HTML_element">
            <header>
                <h2>Anatomy of an HTML element</h2>
            </header>
            <p>Let's explore our paragraph element a bit further:</p>
            <img id="grumpy-cat" src="grumpy-cat-small.png" alt="Example of paragraph tags.">
            <p>The main parts of our element are:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>The opening tag:</strong> This consists of the name of the
                    element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing <strong>
                        angle brackets</strong>. This states where the element begins or starts
                    to take effect -- in this case where the start of the paragraph is.</li>
                <li><strong>The closing tag:</strong> This is the same as the opening tag,
                    except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This
                    states where the elements ends -- in this case where the end of the end of the
                    paragraph is. Failing to include a closing tag is a common beginner error
                    and can lead to strange results.</li>
                <li><strong>The content:</strong> This is the content of the element, which
                    in this case is just text.</li>
                <li><strong>The element:</strong> The opening tag plus the closing tag plus
                    the content equals the element.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Nesting_elements">
            <header>
                <h3>Nesting elements</h3>
            </header>
            <p>You can put elements inside other elements too -- this is
                called <strong>nesting</strong>. If we wanted to state that our cat
                is <strong>very</strong> grumpy, we could wrap the word "very" in a
                <mark>&ltstrong&gt</mark> element, which means that the word is to be strongly emphasized:</p>
            <code id="code">1 | &ltp&gt My cat is &ltstrong&gt very &lt/strong&gt grumpy. &lt/p&gt</code>
            <p>You do however need to make sure that your elements are properly nested:
                in the example above, we opened the <mark>p</mark> element first, then the
                <mark>strong</mark> element, therefore we have to close the <mark>strong</mark>
                element first, then the <mark>p</mark>. </p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Block_versus_inline_elements">
            <header>
                <h3>Block versus inline elements</h3>
            </header>
            <p>There are two important categories of elements in HTML which you should know
                about. They are block-level elements and inline elements.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Block-level elements form a visible block on a page — they will appear
                    on a new line from whatever content went before it, and any content that
                    goes after it will also appear on a new line. Block-level elements tend
                    to be structural elements on the page that represent, for example,
                    paragraphs, lists, navigation menus, footers, etc. A block-level
                    element wouldn't be nested inside an inline element, but it might be
                    nested inside another block-level element.</li>
                <li>Inline elements are those that are contained within block-level elements
                    and surround only small parts of the document’s content, not entire
                    paragraphs and groupings of content. An inline element will not cause
                    a new line to appear in the document; they would normally appear inside
                    a paragraph of text, for example an <mark>&lta&gt</mark> element (hyperlink) or
                    emphasis elements such as <mark>&ltem&gt</mark> or <mark>&ltstrong&gt</mark>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Take the following example:</p>

            <code id="code">1 | &ltem&gtfirst&lt/em&gt&ltem&gtsecond&lt/em&gt&ltem&gtthird&lt/em&gt</code>
            <code id="code">2 | </code>
            <code id="code">3 | &ltp&gtfourth&lt/p&gt&ltp&gtfifth&lt/p&gt&ltp&gtsixth&lt/p&gt</code>

            <p><mark>&ltem&gt</mark> is an inline element, so as you can see below, the first three elements
                sit on the same line as one another with no space in between. On the other
                hand, <mark>&ltp&gt</mark> is a block-level element, so each element appears on a new line,
                with space above and below each (the spacing is due to default CSS styling
                that the browser applies to paragraphs).</p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Empty_elements">
            <header>
                <h3>Empty elements</h3>
            </header>
            <p>Not all elements follow the above pattern of opening tag, content, closing tag.
                Some elements consist only of a single tag, which is usually used to insert/embed
                something in the document at the place it is included. For example, the
                <mark>&ltimg&gt</mark> element embeds an image file onto a page in the position it
                is included in:</p>
            <code
                id="code">1 | &ltimg src=" https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdn/beginner-html-site/gh-pages/images/firefox-icon.png"&gt</code>
            <p>This would output the following on your page:</p>
            <img id="firefox-icon"
                src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdn/beginner-html-site/gh-pages/images/firefox-icon.png"
                alt="firefox-icon">
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Attributes">
            <header>
                <h3>Attributes</h3>
            </header>
            <p></p>
            <img src="" alt="">
            <p>Elements can also have attributes, which look like this:</p>
            <img id="grumpy-cat" src="grumpy-cat-attribute-small.png" alt="Attribute example">
            <p>Attributes contain extra information about the element which you don't want to
                appear in the actual content. In this case, the class attribute allows you to
                give the element an identifying name that can be later used to target the
                element with style information and other things.</p>
            <p>An attribute should have:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute,
                    if the element already has one or more attributes).</li>
                <li>The attribute name, followed by an equal sign.</li>
                <li>An attribute value, with opening and closing quote marks wrapped
                    around it.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Boolean_attributes">
            <header>
                <h3>Boolean attributes</h3>
            </header>
            <p>You'll sometimes see attributes written without values — this is perfectly
                allowed. These are called boolean attributes, and they can only have one
                value, which is generally the same as the attribute name. As an example,
                take the disabled attribute, which you can assign to form input elements
                if you want them to be disabled (greyed out) so the user can't enter any
                data in them.</p>
            <code id="code">1 | &ltinput type="text" disabled&gt</code>
            <p></p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Omitting_quotes_around_attribute_values">
            <header>
                <h3>Omitting quotes around attribute values</h3>
            </header>
            <p>When you look around the World Wide Web, you'll come across a number of
                strange markup styles, including attribute values without quotes. This
                is allowable in certain circumstances, but will break your markup in
                others. For example, if we revisit our link example from earlier, we
                could write a basic version with only the <mark>href</mark> attribute,
                like this:</p>
            <code id="code">1 | &lta href=https://www.mozilla.org/&gt favorite website&lt/a&gt</code>
            <p>However, as soon as we add the title attribute in this style, things will
                go wrong:</p>
            <code id="badCode">1 | &lta href=href=https://www.mozilla.org/ 
                title=The Mozilla homepage&gtfavorite website&lt/a&gt</code>
            <p>At this point the browser will misinterpret your markup, thinking that the
                title attribute is actually three attributes — a title attribute with the
                value "The", and two boolean attributes, <mark>Mozilla</mark> and
                <mark>homepage</mark>. This is obviously not what was intended, and will
                cause errors or unexpected behavior in the code, as seen in the live example
                below. Try hovering over the link to see what the title text is!</p>
            <p>Our advice is to always include the attribute quotes — it avoids such problems,
                and results in more readable code too.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Single_or_double_quotes?">
            <header>
                <h3>Single or double quotes?</h3>
            </header>
            <p>In this article you'll notice that the attributes are all wrapped in double
                quotes. You might however see single quotes in some people's HTML. This is
                purely a matter of style, and you can feel free to choose which one you prefer.
                Both the following lines are equivalent:</p>

            <code>1 | &lta href="http://www.example.com">A link to my example.&lt/a&gt</code>
            <code>2 |</code>
            <code>3 | &lta href='http://www.example.com'>A link to my example.&lt/a&gt</code>

            <p>You should however make sure you don't mix them together.
                The following will go wrong!</p>

            <code id="badCode">&lta href="http://www.example.com'>A link to my example.&lt/a&gt</code>

            <p>If you've used one type of quote in your HTML, you can include the other type of
                quote inside your attribute values without causing any problems:</p>

            <code id="code">1 | &lta href=href="http://www.example.com" title="Isn't this fun?">
                        A link to my example.&lt/a&gt</code>

            <p>However if you want to include a quote within the quotes where both the
                quotes are of the same type(single quote or double quote), you'll have to
                use HTML entities for the quotes. For example, this will break:</p>

            <code id="badCode">1 | &lta href='http://www.example.com' title='Isn't this fun?'>
                        A link to my example.&lt/a&gt</code>

            <p>So you need to do this:</p>

            <code id="code">1 | &lta href='http://www.example.com' title='Isn<span class="token entity" title="'">&amp#39;</span>t this fun?'>
                        A link to my example.&lt/a&gt</code>

            <p>Or this:</p>

            <code id="code">1 | &lta href="http://www.example.com" title="Isn't this fun?">
                            A link to my example.&lt/a&gt</code>
